In this R markdown I will be learning to use the twitter API and running some tests. I am doing this for a class at the University of Minnesota: Health	Data Analytics and Data Science.    
   
   
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library("rtweet") #package for getting data from twitter. 
library("dplyr")
```   
   
      
Creating a token
```{r}
# appname, consumer_key, consumer_secret created in a different R script so that they are not shared with the world. 

twitter_token <- create_token( app = appname,
    consumer_key = consumer_key,
    consumer_secret = consumer_secret)
```   
   
Getting data from twitter and adding to new data frame.  
```{r}
df1 <- search_tweets("#readmissions", n=250)
```
